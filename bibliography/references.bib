  abstract = {Abstract Human character animation is often critical in entertainment content production, including video games, virtual reality or fiction films. To this end, deep neural networks drive most recent advances through deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this article, we propose a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art approaches based on either DL or DRL in skeleton-based human character animation. First, we introduce motion data representations, most common human motion datasets and how basic deep models can be enhanced to foster learning of spatial and temporal patterns in motion data. Second, we cover state-of-the-art approaches divided into three large families of applications in human animation pipelines: motion synthesis, character control and motion editing. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods based on DL and/or DRL in skeletal human character animation and possible directions of future research to alleviate current limitations and meet animators' needs.},

Despite wide adoption of physics simulation for the animation of passive phenomena, such as fluids, cloths and rag-doll characters, commercial applications still resort to kinematics-based approaches for the animation of actively controlled characters. However, following a renewed interest in the use of physics simulation for interactive character animation, many recent publications demonstrate tremendous improvements in robustness, visual quality and usability. We present a structured review of over two decades of research on physics-based character animation, as well as point out various open research areas and possible future directions.},

  abstract   = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.},

abstract = {Abstract Human character animation is often critical in entertainment content production, including video games, virtual reality or fiction films. To this end, deep neural networks drive most recent advances through deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this article, we propose a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art approaches based on either DL or DRL in skeleton-based human character animation. First, we introduce motion data representations, most common human motion datasets and how basic deep models can be enhanced to foster learning of spatial and temporal patterns in motion data. Second, we cover state-of-the-art approaches divided into three large families of applications in human animation pipelines: motion synthesis, character control and motion editing. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods based on DL and/or DRL in skeletal human character animation and possible directions of future research to alleviate current limitations and meet animators' needs.},

abstract = {Abstract Physics simulation offers the possibility of truly responsive and realistic animation. Despite wide adoption of physics simulation for the animation of passive phenomena, such as fluids, cloths and rag-doll characters, commercial applications still resort to kinematics-based approaches for the animation of actively controlled characters. However, following a renewed interest in the use of physics simulation for interactive character animation, many recent publications demonstrate tremendous improvements in robustness, visual quality and usability. We present a structured review of over two decades of research on physics-based character animation, as well as point out various open research areas and possible future directions.},
